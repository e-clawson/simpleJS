//Q4 - sample - sumDividibleByK 

/* you are given an array of integers a and an intefer k.
your task is to calculate the number of ways to pick teo different 
indicies i < j, such that a[i] + a[j] is divisible by k.*/

/* example: 
for a = [1,2,3,4,5] and k = 3, the output should be: 
sumsDivisibleByK(a,k) = 4;

there are 4 pairs of numbers that sum to a multiple of k = 3: 
a[0] + a[1] = 1 + 2 = 3
a[0] + a[4] = 1 + 5 = 6
a[1] + a[3] = 2 + 4 = 6
a[3] + a[4] = 4 + 5 = 9
